# Publishing Your Package

When you are finished with the development of your new package and would like to share it with the world
you should push all code changes to your repository and tag the release.

Then you'll be able to go to the [Packagist](https://packagist.org/) website and add your package to the
repository.

You will link it with your code repository and then you can install it in any Laravel application using
the `composer require` command.
