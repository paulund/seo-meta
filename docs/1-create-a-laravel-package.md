# Laravel Package Development

## Why Create A Laravel Package

When you're developing a Laravel application you might find that you're repeating the same code across multiple
projects. This is where you can create a Laravel package to store this code and reuse it across multiple projects.

By creating a Laravel package you can easily share this code with the community and allow other developers to use
your code in their projects.

## What Is A Laravel Package

A Laravel package is a collection of files that you can drop into any Laravel application, which will add new
functionality to the application.

The package can include routes, controllers, views, and configuration files.

By using composer you can easily install the package into your Laravel application.

## How To Create A Laravel Package

The easiest way to create a Laravel package is to use this `package-template` repository as a template and populate
the files with your own code.

Go to the README.md file in the root of the repository and follow the instructions on how to create a new package.
